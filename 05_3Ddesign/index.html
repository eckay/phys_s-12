      <h4>Scanning: RevoPoint and iOS 3D scanning apps</h4>
      <p>
        The final project component I chose to print this week is the hand for my drawing machine. I wanted to have a model 
        ready to 3D print for Sunday, and didn't feel confident modeling a hand from scratch, so I needed a scan to work off of.
        Because I couldn't make it in to use the RevoPoint until too late, I decided to try using a phone-based photogrammetry/scanning app.
        After consulting some Reddit threads, I landed on five to try out: 3D Scanner App, Scaniverse, Polycam, KIRI Engine,
        and Luma 3D. Because I ended up spending more time than anticipated with them, I've made a little table to help
        future me remember the pros and cons of each. These were my experiences scanning another person's hand by taking photos
        in an orbit around them; I think some of the apps would work better for stationary objects than they did for my needs.

        Because I had some time while waiting for the hand to print, I decided to do a scan with the RevoPoint as well
        for a full comparison. The RevoPoint scanning process took me much longer than any of the photogrammetry apps,
        but that might have been because I was doing it on my own. The RevoScan software gave me much more control over how the mesh was produced 
        and let me decide myself how it should look, but that also meant that producing the mesh took longer and relied on
        my own ability to figure out how to best stitch together my scans. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My RevoPoint mesh (<a href="models/Merge_05_mesh_revo.ply" download>download</a>), seen at right, has the best level of detail and depth of any of the scans. (It's also a MUCH larger file.) 
        If I spend more time putting it together, I think it could be a very good starting point for the hand of my drawing machine should
        I choose to revise it.

        Looking at the lumpy KIRI Engine scan (<a href="models/3DModel.obj" download>download</a>), I realized I needed to edit the mesh if I wanted it as the basis for my drawing
        machine's hand, so I downloaded Blender. I used the sculpt tools, especially smooth, scrape/fill, and fill/deepen,
        to clean up the surface of the hand, as well as the edit tools to try to clean up some weird pits and peaks in the mesh. Once
        satisfied, I used the Boolean modifier to carve out a portion of the hand to hold the drawing machine's pencil.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I brought the mesh into Fusion and used the mesh Repair tool to rebuild it into something that I could
        print (closing holes, etc). Finding there were still some weird points in the mesh, I went through with Erase and Fill
        (under Direct Edit in the Modify section) to try to eliminate the tiny points.

      The print generally worked out well and is able to hold a pencil as required. I had trouble snapping off the organic
      supports, so even though they made the print 10 minutes shorter, I don't think I'd use them again. The biggest issue with the hand
      is that the bottom is rough and uneven where it sat on the bed. That could probably be fixed by printing it in a different
      orientation, but I need to make sure that the layers still go horizontally across the hand for strength in the vertical direction.
      The final component will need a way to attach to the drawing arm, but because I'm not yet certain what that will look like, I didn't include it.
