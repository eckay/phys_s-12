<h3>Final Project: Drawing Automaton</h3>

<p>
  I would still like to make a drawing automaton, or at least the foundation of one. The core of the project will be 
  a drawing machine with an arm that mimics a human arm (wrist, elbow, shoulder). At minimum, I want to build the arm and have it be able to draw
  several basic shapes when prompted. My goal is for it to be able to take as input some sort of path-based image sent from a computer
  and draw that image. 
</p>

<h4>
  Optimistic Timeline:
</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    July 22: An arm that can move across the entire xy-plane where paper will go. This is the part of the project I'm
    most worried about, because I'm still figuring out how it's going to work. Not necessarily driven by motors yet because 
    I'm more concerned about its mechanics in general. I'd like it to have the full range of motion that it will need and determing
    how joints will move in concert. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Weekend of July 26: Figuring out how the motors will drive the arm and what the power source will be. Programming the arm to move to various locations
    on the paper. Ideally able to draw something simple like a line or arc. Needs be able able to move across the drawing
    plane and lift pencil vertically to separate lines. Maybe some sort of pressure sensor to determine z-movement.
  </li>
  <li>
    Week of July 28: If the previous goal has been met, beginning to determine how svg paths or whatever can be translated
    to movements of the arm. Probably will still be figuring out movement, though. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Weekend of August 2: More programming. If things are going well, making decorative features like an body and a head.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>
  Materials:
</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    3 motors whose position I can set to run the arm (servos?)
  </li>
  <li>
    Maybe ~4 sq feet of some sort of plywood to construct a desk and the majority of the arm
  </li>
  <li>
    Some sort of power source for the motors, not sure what the best option would be. Laptop powered would be ideal I think.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pressure sensor (Velostat?)
  </li>
  <li>
    3D printed or cast hand
  </li>
  <li>
    Pencil
  </li>
  <li>
    Microcontroller
  </li>
  <li>
    Joints, maybe 3D printed 
  </li>
</ul>
