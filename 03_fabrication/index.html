    <h4>Kinetic Sculpture <a href="./kinetic_sculpture.f3d" download>(download project)</a></h4>
    <p>I initially wanted to do something inspired by a glockenspiel clock but quickly realized that would be too complicated
    given the timeframe. Following a lot of simplification, that idea turned into a flower that opens and closes. After brainstorming
    a couple ways I could do that, I decided the easiest way to have it open and close would be to push it up and down
    into and out of a cup that would fold the petals in. I googled ways to make rotational movement into linear motion 
    and settled on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_yoke">Scotch yoke</a>. The info I could find on the
    DC motor said it would run at 120 rpm at 3V, and I wanted it at more like 12 rpm, so I used gears to slow down the 
    speed at which the flower would go up and down. I had trouble picturing how it would fit together, so I first made a model 
    in Fusion to get the gist of it. Here's my initial idea roughly in cardboard and my model for how the
    mechanism would work:

    I laser cut the needed pieces out of carboard and 3mm ply and assembled my first draft. The general idea seemed to be OK,
    but due to time constraints I hadn't gotten a chance to cut the pieces to hold the gears in place, so I couldn't be sure
    sure the mechanism would actually work when I wasn't holding it together by hand. And even worse, the "flower" looked
    like a horrible crinoid, so that definitely needed a revision.

    I unfortunately did not get a chance to cut the rest of the pieces I needed to revise the flower, but I did get a chance to 
    cut (some) of the pieces to hold my gears. I used a dowel to conenct the gears and managed to assemble most of the moving parts
    of my flower.

    The vertical part moves at about the speed I had hoped for, and, despite missing some pieces,
    does in fact move more or less correctly. However, approximately ten minutes after I took this video, 
    all the dowels (which had been press-fit or glued in place) decided to become unstuck from their gears, 
    and it fell apart. It did not want to glue back together with hot glue, so tomorrow I'm hoping to reattach it with 
    something stronger.

    My takeaway from this week is the importance of having a plan for how gears and other moving parts will be physically
    held in place. I regret using round holes in the gears, which lets them twist out of their glue very easily. I also discovered 
    how helpful including guide marks on the laser cut pieces can beâ€”by adding cutouts to align the different parts of the base,
    it became much easier to figure out where all the pieces should go relative to each other.
