    <h4>Cardboard Box <a href="./EK_fingerbox.dxf" download>(download dxf)</a></h4>
    <p>For the finger-jointed box, I added some holes for handles and my initials to the basic tutorial design 
    (initials were scored instead of engraved because I didn't want to wait forever). I'd never used a laser 
    cutter before, so I wanted to do something simple to start with. After struggling with Rhino for too long 
    (I could not figure out how to rotate my box sketch correctly), I got my box cut. I had no 
    idea what to set the kerf parameter to, and unfortunately the value I randomly picked based on cursory googling (0.3 mm) 
    was definitely too large because the fit is too snug for the cardboard to slot together happily. </p>

    <p>Because of the tight fit, the bottom fingers fit together really nicely, but the tops ones required too much effort to
    get in place. I ended up smooshing them while trying to slot them in, so now they're too floppy to be 100% 
    functional. If I were to try cutting it again, I'd slightly reduce the kerf, but the box stays together well 
    enough to hold weight while I carry it around so it feels like a waste to recut it.</p>

    <h4>Fusion 360 Tutorial <a href="./week-2-tutorials.zip" download>(download f3d zip)</a></h4>
    <p>
      For this part of the assignment, I did the first few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A&t=38s">"Fusion 360 in 30 Days for Complete Beginners"</a> videos 
      linked from the class site. Key points from the videos were (1) canvas: trace an image, (2) sweep tool: makes solid 
      from 2d profile that follows a sketch path, (3) loft: connects sketch profiles in order of connection and uses guide
      rails to add more specificity. Here're some pics of models from the tutorials:

    <h4>Modeling Household Objects in Fusion <a href="./cat toy v3.f3d" download>(download f3d zip)</a></h4>
    <p>
      The first object I chose is my cat's favorite toy. It seemed like a good starting point because I was 
      considering using it in a final project idea and because it's mostly cylindrical forms. It's built using 
      extrude for the handle, loft for the tapering middle part, the torus tool for a little rubber ring by the handle, 
      and revolve for the metal piece at the tip. My biggest takeaway was to set parameters at the beginning
      so I wouldn't have to keep referencing my bad notes for measurements.

      For the object made from multiple components, I modeled a pair of kitchen scissors. I traced over a canvas of
       the blade and handle to get the basic shapes down, then extruded various faces to make the body. When I couldn't 
      figure out how to make the blade, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z078TEfmvJM">this video</a>,
      which taught me about the plane along path tool. This time I actually set up my parameters first, which ended up being very necessary
      when I put the scissors together to discover they did not match up correctly and realized I'd forgotten to add 
      one measurement to the height of an extrusion. I also learned the importance of selecting paste new if I'm 
      planning to make edits to a copy of a component. I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fw6kvTei1M">this tutorial</a>
      for the screw and nut holding the scissors together.
